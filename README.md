# dnsBench
Test and rank DNS servers by speed, dnsBench is a simple shell script that queries a list of popular DNS servers and ranks them by response time.

### How To Use
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tushgaurav/dns-bench/main/main.sh | bash
```

### Why create dnsBench?
I was learning about DNS servers and wanted to use the fastest one with my AdGuard Home setup. Also creating this script helps me to flex my bash scripting skills.
